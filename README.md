# GitHub to Jira Action 🚀

Welcome to **GitHub to Jira Action**! This GitHub Action automates the synchronization of issues, sprints, story points, and statuses between GitHub Projects and Jira Projects. It helps to streamline your project management by mapping relevant fields from GitHub to Jira, so you can easily manage your tasks and track progress.

## Key Features 🌟
- Synchronize **GitHub issues** with **Jira tasks**.
- Automatically map **issue types** (Epics, Features, Bugs, etc.) from GitHub labels to Jira issue types.
- Map **sprint**, **story points**, and **status** from GitHub Projects to Jira.
- Supports **batch synchronization** with custom batch size configurations.
- **status mapping** from GitHub to Jira with default values.
  
## How It Works ⚙️
This GitHub Action reads configuration from a YAML file to map your GitHub issues and project data to corresponding fields in Jira. The tool enables seamless integration, updating Jira based on changes made in GitHub issues.

### What is Mapped?
- **Story Points**: Extracted from a GitHub custom field and synced to Jira.
- **Status**: Mapped from GitHub issue status to Jira issue status.
- **Sprints**: Synced from GitHub to the corresponding Jira sprint board.
- **Issue Types**: GitHub labels are mapped to Jira issue types (e.g., Epic, Feature, Bug, Task).

## Configuration 📋

To use **GitHub to Jira Action**, configure the tool using a YAML file that defines the mappings and project synchronization details.

Here’s a breakdown of how to configure the YAML file:

Store it under the name sync.yaml at the root folder of the repository.

### Example YAML Configuration

## How to Use 🚀

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Workflow

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # every hour    
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

name: Sync GitHub to Jira

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Restore state from previous run using GitHub variables (no secret inside)
        run: |
          if [ -z "${{ vars.SYNC_STATE }}" ]; then
            echo "no previous persisted state"
          else
            echo "restoring previous sync state"
            echo "${{ vars.SYNC_STATE }}" > sync-state.yaml
            cat sync-state.yaml
          fi

        # use development branch of the action (next is the build from the main branch)
      - name: Run GitHub to Jira Action
        uses: benoitf/github-to-jira-action@next
        with:
          jira-host: ${{ secrets.JIRA_HOST }}
          jira-email: ${{ secrets.JIRA_EMAIL }}
          jira-write-token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_WRITE_TOKEN }}
          github-read-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

        # save the state using a custom token as default GITHUB_TOKEN does not have the required permissions
        # to save variables
      - name: persist state
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SET_VARIABLE_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          # use gh cli to save the content of a file into a variable
          gh variable set SYNC_STATE < sync-state.yaml
```

It is using GitHub variables to store the state between each run. GitHub Actions don't have permissions for that,
so write access needs to be granted to the step `persist state`.
In the example above, `GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SET_VARIABLE_GITHUB_TOKEN }}` is granting that permission.

From GitHub UI it is then possible to view the current state of each repo sync (and optionally delete it).

### Step 2: Add the YAML Configuration

Copy the above workflow YAML to a workflow file in your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/execute-sync.yaml`).

Place your `github-to-jira-action` YAML configuration file in `sync.yaml`.

### Step 3: Configure Secrets 🔐

You need to provide Jira credentials and GitHub tokens as secrets in your repository:

1. Go to **Settings > Secrets > Actions** in your GitHub repository.
2. Add the following secrets:
   - **JIRA_HOST**: The base URL of your Jira instance (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net` for Jira Cloud).
   - **JIRA_EMAIL**: The email address associated with your Jira account (required for Jira Cloud authentication).
   - **JIRA_WRITE_TOKEN**: Your Jira API token with write access. For Jira Cloud, generate this from [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).

The **GITHUB_TOKEN** secret is one from the default GitHub Actions. It is ok to use this token if all GitHub projects/issues data are publicly available.

### Jira Cloud Authentication

This action uses **Basic Authentication** for Jira Cloud, which requires:
- Your Jira account email address
- An API token (not your password)

To create a Jira Cloud API token:
1. Log in to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Give it a label (e.g., "GitHub to Jira Sync")
4. Copy the token and add it as the `JIRA_WRITE_TOKEN` secret

**Note**: For Jira Data Center/Server, you would use a Personal Access Token instead, but this action is now configured for Jira Cloud's authentication method.

---

### Step 4: Ensure JIRA scheme/components are valid in JIRA project

 - Ensure `Story Points` field is available on every issue type.
 - Ensure the issues types are available in the JIRA project (by default it may only be a subset like only `Bug` and `Task`).
 - Ensure the statuses/transitions (`CLOSED`/`IN PROGRESS`/etc.) are available in the JIRA project.
 - Ensure that the component(s) referenced in the configuration YAML file exist in the JIRA project.

---

### Step 5: Run the Action

Once the workflow and configuration file are committed to the repository, the
action will automatically run based on your schedule.  It will also be triggered
when you merge updates (such as configuration changes) to the repository `main`
branch.  And, you can manually trigger it from the **Actions** tab in your
repository GitHub page.

---

## Advanced Options 🛠️

- **Max Batch Size**: Control how many issues are synced in one batch. Set `maxBatchSize` to `0` for turn it off.
- **Status Mappings**: Customize how GitHub statuses (e.g., "📋 Backlog", "🚧 In Progress") are mapped to Jira statuses.
- **Date Filtering**: Use the `afterDate` field to only sync issues created after a specific date.

---

## Troubleshooting ❓

- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure your Jira API token and GitHub tokens are correctly configured in GitHub secrets.
- **Sync Errors**: Check the logs in the **Actions** tab for detailed information on any errors during synchronization.
- **Always syncing the same issues**: Check the save/restore part of the state. Without state, it is always starting from the same date.
